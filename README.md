## Hey, I'm Cameron ðŸŒ†
Portfolio website [here!](https://entzmingerc.github.io/website/)  
I recently graduated from University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2023 with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. During my time there I researched real-time thermal modeling techniques for power electronics. I've got experience working at national labs, doing data analysis in the renewable energy industry, and I spend my freetime developing musical instruments. I'm currently teaching myself C++ to create a modular synth from scratch.
- ðŸŒ± Using C++, STM32H7 development board, and KiCAD to make drumcrow real.
- ðŸŽ¶ Recently released the [nb_drumcrow](<https://github.com/entzmingerc/nb_drumcrow>) synthesizer, updating [pit orchisstra](<https://github.com/entzmingerc/pit-orchisstra>), and dreaming of porting [RAVE](<https://github.com/entzmingerc/RAVE_instrument>) to a hardware device somehow.  
- ðŸŒ» Interested in anything renewables and music hardware.
- ðŸ“– Python, Lua, MATLAB, COMSOL, and SuperCollider.
