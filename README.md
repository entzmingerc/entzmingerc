## Hey, I'm Cameron 🌆

I recently graduated from University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2023 with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. During my time there I researched real-time thermal modeling techniques for power electronics. I've got experience working at national labs, doing data analysis in the renewable energy industry, and I spend my freetime programming musical sequencers apps. I'm currently learning how apply deep learning for real-time musical applications.
