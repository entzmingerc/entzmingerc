## Hey, I'm Cameron ðŸŒ†

I recently graduated from University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2023 with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. During my time there I researched real-time thermal modeling techniques for power electronics. I've got experience working at national labs, doing data analysis in the renewable energy industry, and I spend my freetime developing musical instruments. I'm currently teaching myself C++ to create a modular synth from scratch.
